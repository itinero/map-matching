This track was collected on a trip by bike while surveying for OpenStreetMap.

The track starts fairly easy but there are a few challenges later on:
- It goes through a road that is mapped as oneway in OpenStreetMap at the time of writing
  (2019-07-27). (This may be a data error in OSM, we might survey and correct that in the future).
- The person dismounted and crossed on foot near Oktrooiplein where cycling wasn't allowed.
- He used roads mapped with access=private that looked "public enough".
- He dismounted and walked on the railway platform of Gent-Dampoort station.

The data points sometimes appear to reverse at junctions, which is an extra challenge if a logical
route is desired, and not just a collection of edges that were visited. The trip contains a few
legitimate U-turns, so just disallowing those will provide an inaccurate result.

This makes it an interesting and challenging test for mapmatching algorithms.
